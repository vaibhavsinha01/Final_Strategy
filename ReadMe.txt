Coding the broker wrapper is done now i just have to call its class and use their function.-done
Here first i will write the strategy and make as many changes in the test folder and save the graph and info in the data folder.
I will chose the strategy then try to optimize it's parameter using the MachineLearning first.
Then i will code the strategy check and refine it.
Finally then i will do the backtesting on the code and refine its risk management and then i will do the forward testing on the code. 
Finally i will compare the backtesting results with the Forward testing result if both of those are good and working i will submit the code.
